# Hung-Parliament

##------OVERVIEW------

Hung Parliament is a command line video game where the player, as Prime Minister, must get their legislation passed. The politicians who
form Parliament share ideas across a network and their affinity for particular ideas are determined by differences between their own
characteristics and those of the idea. A politician's affinity for an idea is affected by two additonal factors: the influence exerted 
by politicians within their social circle who also possess that idea; and the characteristics of the other ideas the politician currently 
possesses.
The player must gain a majority vote for their legislation when the timer runs out. As legislation is classed as an idea it is adopted by
politicians in the same way as above. To push support for their legislation, the player must spread ideas that will increase politicians'
affinity for it. They can also spend credibility points to bribe or threaten politicians for support.
The player starts off with 100 credibility points. They lose points for each legislation voted down and for any spent in persuasion. When
the credibility points reach zero, the player loses.
The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible before running out of credibility points.

##------Screenshots------

The first screenshot shows some of the options available to the player. 
  - White text represents the main menu
  - Red texts are messages from the Whip providing updates on how ideas spread across the network
  - Blue texts are conversations with politicians
  
The player can request statistics from the Whip to inform them of who the best politicians to target are. They can add new ideas to their
arsenal by speaking to politicians. These can they be suggested to others, as seen in the second screenshot.
